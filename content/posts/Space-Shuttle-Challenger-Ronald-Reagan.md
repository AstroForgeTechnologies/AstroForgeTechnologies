title: Space Shuttle Challenger (Ronald Reagan)
---

Whenever you think of Space travel what do you think of? Apollo 11 and neil armstrong or maybe even space x’s first landing of the falcon 9 rocket. But what you don’t think of is the ones who died along the way. Like the the Challenger STS-51 L accident of January 28th, 1986 where 7 people died. Well at the time Ronald Reagan gave a speech to the entirety of the USA. Where he empathizes deeply how the loss of these people affected him and everyone else in the country and also announces to everyone that the quest for space travel will not stop and just like these people bravely put their foot forward at adversity we shall to because “The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave.’”






This speech is an example of a successful attempt of giving a speech about recover over major loss of the seven people on that shuttle. And to reignite hope in american people about space travel. This is an important message because some  times bad things will happen and it is important to be able to talk about things and recover from them just Ronald reagan did in this speech.  He does this through a variety of techniques (list)





Starting with the most important one in any speech Pathos(or sadness).  This technique is what keeps the entire speech together. He speaks in a slow, low and sad tone, he does this to show his empathy for all affected by the loss of these people. If he were to talk exited and have a faster pase of speaking it would seem  dismissive to the death of all of these people.




To demonstrate this I will show a clip shows clip of him saying “we mourn seven heroes”  do you see how he keeps a solum tone and when he talks, he takes long pauses after each sentence not only to remove filler words but to take time on each name he says to show each one matter . He does not move a lot while saying this. He does this to let us know he cares, having a lot of movement can suggest excitement but the tone of this speech is solum so he does not act this way . If he were to say and act like really excited like this  says the quote but exited do you see how disingenuous that sounds like he doesn’t care.




Even after the part where he is talking about moving forward, he still keeps his  slower and in a solum tone. Which displays his solitude and great sadness toward this subject. Without this technique this speech would have quickly back fired looking like a PR stunt than a speech of empathy, understanding, loss but still giving hope and to still encourage people to stay hopeful about the future.










Language techniques  and Metaphors are another technique that play into the understanding and empathic side of the speech. At the start of the speech he says  “ painted to the core by this tragedy of the shuttle challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.”




   In this excerpt of the speech Ronald reagans’ language choices show us he cares. He says he is “painted” to the core which displays how truly upset he is about the situation. But he also uses inclusive language like “we know we share this pain” and later said “this truly is a national loss” This is an example of the inclusive language effect. By talking to people as they are party of a community they will feel more attached to the speech because they would feel more included  and there fourth the message. With this technique Ronald reagan easily able to gain support from the nation.







This is speech is not just that empathetic and understanding part, but ronald reagan is also able to announce that space travel will still continue and everyone being happy with the speech and the end outcome he does this by doing a slight  Anacoluthon which means to change the ideas quickly in a speech. In Ronald reagan's speech it is more gradual but it is just as effective. He does this when he says




 “I want to say something to the schoolchildren of america who were watching the live coverage…..sometimes painful things happen…… Its all part of taking a chance and expand man’s horizons….. The future  doesn’t belong  to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave.”  





This is the bridge that goes towards the part about restoring hope in the american population. He starts with his usual message but it was towards the schoolchildren who watched. He talks to them like a parent talking about loss with their child.  Then he continues in this soft tone which is a great segway to now addresses the whole nation and saying how this is risk is necessary to progress. This is an extremely good example of making a segway and switch in the subject of the speech, Ronald reagan swiftly went from talking about the loss of people to the future of the nation.





In conclusion this speech was a very effective one of dealing with loss, speaking with empathy and installing hope into american again. He does this by his tone (or pathos), his language choices and metaphors, and the efficiency of the speech.
