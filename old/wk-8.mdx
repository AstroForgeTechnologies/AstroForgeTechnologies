During week 8, we started looking at the designs of the rocket that will be bringing us to Mars.
We looked at different designs, engines, how big it has to be, and how it will land on Mars.
We also looked at a Day in the life of the ISS, Bone Density and Health as some additional information to our project.
First with the design of the rocket we have looked at having a space craft similar to the ISS first we are going to send up bits and pieces of the rocket up into space and build it up there.
We do this because our space ship needs a lot of room to put things and all of that will be too heavy to leave earths orbit.
Then we get this space ship and using the nuclear engine we travel to mars, to get people from the ship to mars we will use space pods.
