## Website Inspiration

The base of the whole project was [AstroPaper Theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper), although we diverted away from the theme via our colour scheme and typography, in the homepage, with the table of contents, with the navigation, with the navbar, and with the main section pages.

The main inspiration for our homepage and navbar was the [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) homepage. Some base code for the homepage was also taken from there.

Inspiration for the Table of Contents was from [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/), as well as [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Tools Used

We used many tools during the process of building this project. An non-inclusive list includes:

- [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com/)

### AI Usage

We used AI in Generating our Company Name, Company Slogan, and Company Icon, as of the 1st of May 2024.

For the logo, the `.jpg` image file was converted into a `.svg` via the [Adobe Express JPG to SVG Converter](https://new.express.adobe.com/tools/convert-to-svg?$web_only=true&_branch_match_id=1316603738694907186&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXT0zJT0otLkgsyi7ILy7RLU9N0kssKNDLyczL1k/Vj6qIyM6y9PAw9UgCACXYts0xAAAA),  and then manually cleaned up using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

This usage of AI was approved by our supervisor at the time, *Mr. Peter Hughes*.
