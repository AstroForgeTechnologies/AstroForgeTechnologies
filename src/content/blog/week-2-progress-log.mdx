In week 2, we went through what the entire project will be about - planning for the journey and establishment of leaving Earth to another planet our moon. We discussed key questions such as, Where do we go, how do we get there, and
how do we survive when we do get there? We briefly decided that our destination would be Mars, as other planets are either unreachable, or inhabitable as we have discovered during our research.
