During week 4, we conducted more detailed research on factors and issues during the journey, arrival and establishment to/on Mars and created a shared brainstorm to input ideas. Some factors we included in the brainstorm are psychological issues, solar radiation, temperature, resources (oxygen, food, water) and gravity. We came up with some feasible ideas such as coma, radiation protection vests, oxygen generator, water from the poles of Mars and etc.
