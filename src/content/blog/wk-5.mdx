In week 5, we looked into the issues more deeply and focused on the specific and more feasible ideas in particular. We looked into settling in lava tubes or caves on Mars, and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of living in lava tubes. Such as lava tubes are large so there would be more space, but lava tubes are far away from potential water sources. We also started looking at plans for journey and ship, such as how much food we need for the journey, which type of space ship would be most effective, etc. We also looked into pros and cons of increasing weight as a solution to the low-gravity condition on Mars, as well as storage and temperature problems.
