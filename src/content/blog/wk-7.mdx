In week 7, discussed various topics specifically.\
Storage: How do we maximise how much we can bring to space?

Ship: Nuclear Engines? Ion Engines? Building in space? - Decision - Most likely with two engines, chemical engine for the stronger thrust required to leave Earth's orbit, and nuclear engine for the long journey, most like building in space.

Location in Mars: Altitude? Latitude? Dust Storm Maps? Toxic Effects of Martian Dust? - /

Oxygen, Water, Food: Main Focus of Oxygen & Water. - /

We conducted research on each of these topics and contributed to the brainstorm.
