## Introduction

This week, working towards the deadline, we mostly focused on typing out the sections, the main information base of our website. This was setup [4 Weeks Ago](https://github.com/AstroForgeTechnologies/AstroForgeTechnologies.github.io/commit/e0712151484f0e3afc79671ca8ad804e6ce7fad0), but was only started last week, thus there was a lot more to complete.

Isaac also began working on the website, completely and with great urgency, starting with the homepage. Although the sections are not visible on the website yet, Isaac is planning to have it done before next Tuesday.

## Temporary Change in Leadership

This week, instead of Isaac, Christy became our leader. This decision was made to encourage more diversity and support within our group, as well as encouraging all group members to form closer bonds with each other.

Next week, we have thoughts of Will become the group leader, but it may depend on how our progress is going.

Christy assigned Will to work on the 'Location' and 'Astronauts' sections in that order, and assigned herself the 'Resources', 'Base' and 'Ship & Journey' sections in that order. She assigned Isaac to work on the website, amid fears of long development times.
