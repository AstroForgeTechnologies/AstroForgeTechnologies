Where On Mars

* Discuss Lava Tubes, Caves

In week 5, we looked into NASA's DRACO program of launching a nuclear spacecraft as nuclear engines are much more efficient than traditional chemical rockets. This program is done to test out the nuclear engine for later travelling to Mars. Due to the engine still in its testing period, we will have to assume that it can be an option of travelling to Mars in the future if we are considering this idea.![](</assets/images/Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 10.12.02.png>)

In this week, we also discovered that silica aerogel could be used to transmit light for photosynthesis, block radiation, and raise temperature in our base. Not only that, but this ![](</assets/images/Screenshot 2024-03-28 at 10.03.56.png>)Aerogel could be used to keep temperature and as a protection as radiation.
