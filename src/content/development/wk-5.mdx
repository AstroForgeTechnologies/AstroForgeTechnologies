In week 5, we looked into NASA's DRACO program of launching a nuclear spacecraft as nuclear engines are much more efficient than traditional chemical rockets. This program is done to test out the nuclear engine for later travelling to Mars. Due to the engine still in its testing period, we will have to assume that it can be an option of travelling to Mars in the future if we are considering this idea.![](</assets/images/Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 10.12.02.png> "Figure 1: NASA's DRACO program.")

In this week, we also discovered that silica aerogel could be used to transmit light for photosynthesis, block radiation, and raise temperature in our base. Not only that, but this 

For maintaining temperature, we discovered silica aerogel, a material where the interconnecting nanolayers of silicon dioxide could block the heavy solar radiation on Mars, transmit light for photosynthesis, and raise the temperature in the base. Meaning that this could be the possible solution for both protecting astronauts from solar radiation and keeping the temperature warm enough, shown below retrieved from the brainstorming board (Figure 2).![](</assets/images/Screenshot 2024-03-28 at 10.03.56.png> "Figure 2: Silica aerogel")
