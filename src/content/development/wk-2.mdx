Started a Brainstorming Board

Why we decided on Mars

State how long it takes to travel to exoplanets

Why terraforming is not viable

Basic Problems (Food Water Oxygen)

In week 2, we went through what the entire project will be about - planning for the journey and establishment of leaving Earth to another planet or moon. We discussed key questions such as, Where do we go, how do we get there, and
how do we survive when we do get there? We conducted research on each possible destination that we could travel to, and presented them in the brainstorm as shown below. Some of the options on the list were Mars, Venus, one of Saturn or Jupiter's moons, Kepler-452b (an exoplanet closest to our solar system).

We briefly decided that our destination would be Mars, as other planets are either unreachable, or inhabitable as we have discovered during our research.![](</assets/images/images/Brainstorm 1.png> "Figure 1: Planets Brainstorming")
