In week 7, discussed various topics specifically.

Storage: How do we maximise how much we can bring to space

Storage is a crucial factor during the journey as well as establishment on Mars. Considering the amount of food, materials, and many other things we need to bring with us to Mars, it is important that we manage and organise our things. Below in Figure 1 shows the ideas we briefly had for our problem with storage. We thought that astronauts could store food in cans, ziplock bags and retort pouches to keep it air tight and small. We could also make sure that objects don't have curves so we can store them easily, maximising the space.![](</assets/images/Screenshot 2024-03-28 at 10.12.14.png> "Figure 1: Storage")

This week, we looked deeper into the engine of the spaceship. We found out that nuclear engines do not have a strong enough thrust to bring us out of Earth. So our decision is that we will most likely have two engines, chemical engine for the stronger thrust required to leave Earth's orbit, and nuclear engine for the long journey. The spaceship will also most likely be built in space as it would be massive in size. ![](</assets/images/Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 09.30.43.png>)

Location in Mars: Altitude? Latitude? Dust Storm Maps? Toxic Effects of Martian Dust? 

During this week, we researched on where we will be 

Oxygen, Water, Food: Main Focus of Oxygen & Water. - /

We conducted research on each of these topics and contributed to the brainstorm.
