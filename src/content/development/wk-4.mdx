During week 4, we conducted more detailed research on factors and issues during the journey, arrival and establishment to/on Mars and created a shared brainstorm to input ideas. Some factors we included in the brainstorm are psychological issues, solar radiation, and temperature, shown below. Some solutions we came up with and conducted brief research on were putting people in coma, terraforming, and solar radiation protection vest, shown below.
