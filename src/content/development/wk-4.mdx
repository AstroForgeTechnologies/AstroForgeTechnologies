At the start of week 4, we discussed the team roles in the our team. We decided that Will is the devil's advocate, Isaac is the fleet commander and the explorer, and Christy will be the prioritiser and innovator, as shown in Figure 1 retrieved from the brainstorming board.

Our main focus for this week is on oxygen and water. We discussed some possible solutions for the problem of lack of oxygen and food on Mars, as well as during the journey to Mars. For oxygen we looked at ideas such as retrieving oxygen from Martian soil, using NASA's MOXIE oxygen generator, briefly on electrolysis of water where we could separate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules. This is shown below in Figure 2.

We also looked at some factors of psychological issues, such as human's need of connection. Some ideas we came up with were making a space society, deciding on a leader, and having ways for astronauts to connect with people on Earth, shown below (Figure 3) retrieved from the brainstorming board.

Looked at Journey Length (7 Months at this point)

Looked at Solar Radiation

During week 4, we conducted more detailed research on factors and issues during the journey, arrival and establishment to/on Mars and created a shared brainstorm to input ideas. Some factors we included in the brainstorm are psychological issues, solar radiation, and temperature, shown below. Some solutions we came up with and conducted brief research on were putting people in coma, terraforming, and solar radiation protection vest, shown below.
