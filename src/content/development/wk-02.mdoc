At the start of the week, we created a brainstorming board on Miro, where we can discuss and list out our ideas. We went through what the entire project will be about - planning for the journey and establishment of leaving Earth to another planet or moon. We discussed key questions such as, Where do we go, how do we get there, and how do we survive when we do get there? We conducted research on each possible destination that we could travel to, and presented them in the brainstorm as shown below. Some of the options on the list were Mars, Venus, one of Saturn or Jupiter's moons, Kepler-452b (an exoplanet closest to our solar system).

We briefly decided that our destination would be Mars, as other planets are either unreachable, or inhabitable as we have discovered during our research. Mars would be the best destination, since it is within our solar system and the closest possible planet to Earth. This would bring advantages to us later in the project as the travel time would be much shorter compared to travelling to other planets or moons. Mars' environment is also not very extreme like planets such as Venus. We thought about the closest exoplanet (Kepler-452b) to our solar system that is fairly similar to Earth and the environment is ideal. However, it would take us about 7 million years to travel from Earth to Kepler-452b. Below shows our brainstorm on planets we considered as a destination.

This week, we also discussed some possible issues during the journey and establishment on Mars. We listed out the problems, including Gravity, food, water, oxygen, and psychological issues. We briefly started researching and discussing the basic problems. More research and communication is to be done in the future weeks.
