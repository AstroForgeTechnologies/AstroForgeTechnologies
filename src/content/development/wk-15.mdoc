## Introduction

This week, Isaac finished off the final CAD design, work on the website was done, and work on the major content information, which is being called the 'sections' for now, was conducted.

## Final CAD Design

The CAD Ship Design has been split into its modules, and has been rendered. There were also two versions made of the design; one with high resolution materials and objects for rendering images, and one with lower resolution materials and simple objects for use in the browser, on the homepage. The renders are shown below, in Figures 1-5.
