At the start of the week, we focused on storage and maintaining temperature. For storage, we very briefly looked at storing food for the journey as shown in Figure 1 below.

For maintaining temperature, we discovered silica aerogel, a material where the interconnecting nanolayers of silicon dioxide could block the heavy solar radiation on Mars, transmit light for photosynthesis, and raise the temperature in the base. Meaning that this could be the possible solution for both protecting astronauts from solar radiation and keeping the temperature warm enough, shown below retrieved from the brainstorming board (Figure 2).

For gravity issues, we came up with an idea that we could let people slowly adapt to the gravity on Mars by decreasing reliance on either plates (with certain weight) or centrifuge. If they are ever going back to Earth, this can be reversed by increasing reliance on plates or centrifuge.![](</assets/images/MAP OF GRAVITY.png>)

During the week, we also discovered that the use of nuclear engine on our spaceship could potentially bring us to Mars in only about 45 days. This was mentioned in quite a few websites, but most are saying that it is still being tested so we are making an assumption that in the future, nuclears engines will be able to help us to travel from Earth to Mars in 45 days.

At the end of the week, we had discussions of the ideas that could work as a solution to the problems in the brainstorm. Each member presented their findings in detail to the group and talked through which solution would be the best, or how we could merge some of the ideas together for a better final decision. We decided finally the solutions for most of the problems while some other still require research for better options, such as food, water, oxygen problems, etc. Shown below are the final decided solutions for some of the problems.
