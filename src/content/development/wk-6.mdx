At the start of the week, we focused on storage and maintaining temperature. For storage, we very briefly looked at storing food for the journey as shown in Figure 1 below.

Looked at Storage, Maintaining Temperature - aerogel

At the end of the week, we had discussions of the ideas that could work as a solution to the problems in the brainstorm. Each member presented their findings in detail to the group and talked through which solution would be the best, or how we could merge some of the ideas together for a better final decision. We decided finally the solutions for most of the problems while some other still require research for better options, such as food, water, oxygen problems, etc. Shown below are the final decided solutions for some of the problems.
