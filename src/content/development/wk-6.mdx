At the start of the week, we focused on storage and maintaining temperature. For storage, we very briefly looked at storing food for the journey as shown in Figure 1 below.

For maintaining temperature, we discovered silica aerogel, a material where the interconnecting nanolayers of silicon dioxide could block the heavy solar radiation on Mars, transmit light for photosynthesis, and raise the temperature in the base. Meaning that this could be the possible solution for both protecting astronauts from solar radiation and keeping the temperature warm enough, shown below retrieved from the brainstorming board (Figure 2).

During the week, we also discovered that nuclear engine

At the end of the week, we had discussions of the ideas that could work as a solution to the problems in the brainstorm. Each member presented their findings in detail to the group and talked through which solution would be the best, or how we could merge some of the ideas together for a better final decision. We decided finally the solutions for most of the problems while some other still require research for better options, such as food, water, oxygen problems, etc. Shown below are the final decided solutions for some of the problems.

Looked deeper at the idea of adapting to Mars' gravity

Discovered Nuclear Engines
