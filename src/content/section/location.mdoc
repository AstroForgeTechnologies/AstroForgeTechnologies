We have decided Mars for our location to land at we did this through a process of elimination. Our contenders were Mars, Vennus, Titan and Promixa Centauri b. Immediately we can not do Promixa Centauri b because it is too far away around 4.2 light years away(Nasa, 2019) and since we have no where near cracked light speed travel and our fasted rocket is the Parker Solar Probe traveling at 635,266 km/h (earth.com, 2023) which is no where close to the speed of light being 1.079Ã—10

&nbsp;km which would take 813.8 years meaning it would have to be a generational flight which is not going to happen. The next planted that we looked at is Vennus and it is not too far away this time but the pressure of Vennus would be too strong for any human to handle being 92 bar or 1,350 psi (The planetary society, 2023) it is unknown what exactly the breaking point for humans is but 1,350 psi would definitely do some damage. Titain is the final planet we decided that we were not going to do and the  biggest problem is the 2 year time it takes even using nuclear rockets (Popular Mechanics,2023) meaning that we would have to keep everyone on a ship doing nothing happy for 2 years and on the ship we would have to supply food and water for 2 years and you would have to send water to everyone in 2 years which would not be sustainable.  That's how we ended up on Mars but it is not without it's issues the first one being as soon as you land on the ground with the gravity being a lot lower than earths. This would not be a problem if we were to stay on mars but if we wanted to expand to other planets or move back to earth we would be crushed under that gravity and the second problem would be the dust and the storms. The dust on mars in toxic to humans and if it gets staticly stuck on the space suits and if that happens and someone goes into the base it could end up killing everyone.
