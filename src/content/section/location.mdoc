We have decided Mars for our location to land at we did this through a process of elimination. Our contenders were Mars, Vennus, Titan and Promixa Centauri b. Immediately we can not do Promixa Centauri b because it is too far away around 4.2 light years away(Nasa, 2019) and since we have no where near cracked light speed travel and our fasted rocket is the Parker Solar Probe traveling at 635,266 km/h (earth.com, 2023) which is no where close to the speed of light being 1.079Ã—10

&nbsp;km which would take 813.8 years meaning it would have to be a generational flight which is not going to happen. The next planted that we looked at is Vennus and it is not too far away this time but the pressure of Vennus would be too strong for any human to handle being 92 bar or 1,350 psi (The planetary society, 2023) it is unknown what exactly the breaking point for humans is but 1,350 psi would definitely do some damage.\
