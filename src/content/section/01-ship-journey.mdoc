## Introduction

The ship used in the mission is a critical factor in determining the mission's success or failure.

The ship must be fast, to ensure efficient and proper use of resources, as well as allowing rescue and supply missions to and from Mars as quickly as possible.

It must be resilient to failures and accidents, which will surely happen over the first, as well as consequent, missions to and from Mars.

It must have sustainable and reliable power generation, allowing for critical medical equipment, usage of the centrifuge, and backup thrusters.

And finally, it must support the crew, especially in their health, to ensure they are fit and prepared once on Mars.

The final ship design, the **RUBBER I**, is shown below in Figure 1, included with an artistic representation of Earth & Mars.

## Ship Design

### General Design

The General Design of the **RUBBER I** is in a way where it is able to be used for many subsequent missions to and from Mars. Everything in the spaceship is based around the idea of reliability, reusability, modularity and to be resilient to failures and accidents.

### Segmentation

#### Modularity

The **RUBBER I** is split up into **22 Modules**. These modules are, and are shown in Figure 2:

- 1x Nose & Cockpit *(5.57m by 5.57m by 5.01m)*
- 1x Front Module *(5.57m by 5.57m by 7.25m)*
- 1x Middle Module *(5.32m by 5.32m by 21.5m)*
- 1x Back Module *(8m by 8m by 14.8m)*
- 1x Chemical Exhaust *(3.26m by 3.26m by 3.1m)*
- 2x Nuclear Exhaust *(1.86m by 1.86m by 2.63m)*
- 6x Solar Panels *(16.9m by 3m by 0.66m)*
- 3x Centrifuge Travel Poles *(2m by 2m by 6.5m)*
- 6x Centrifuge Modules *(6.51m by 8.65m by 3m)*

This split-up of the ship, especially separating key areas such as the thruster, fuel tanks, main crew area, centrifuge, solar panels, and the cockpit, allows for parts to be replaced and repaired easily in the future, ensuring that the **RUBBER I** can continue having the state-of-the-art safety, cryogenic, power and engine systems.

Furthermore, this separation of modules allow for easy expansion of the **RUBBER I** in the future.

This idea of modules for the **RUBBER I** was initially from the modules of the *International Space Station (ISS)*. The modules of the ISS are shown in Figure 3.

#### Redundancy

With the modules allowing for segmentation of the spacecraft, in the event of a failure or breakage of a given module, the module can be removed, and the spacecraft will still survive. This is conducted through redundancy.

For example, in worse-case scenario, where the fuel tank and main thrusters module must be disconnected, the electronic thrusters in each module allow for the **RUBBER I** to make it back to Earth safely.

Furthermore, this is accomplished by storing equipment and critical resources in multiple places, allowing the crew to survive, and perhaps continue the mission, in the event of sudden losses of modules.

### Centrifuge

The Centrifuge is a large part of the spaceship, being a vital support for the crew, and the presence of it ensures the **RUBBER I**'s relevancy, reliability and usability for many years and missions to come. This is because the Centrifuge generates artificial gravity, in the Zero G environments of space, allowing crew members to perform exercise activities and other daily tasks in a 'normal' environment, preserving their physical health and fitness, ensuring they are at their maximum capabilities once on Mars.

### Why so Large?

The **RUBBER I** is a very big spaceship, coming in at a full size of *35.2m (W) by 20m (H) by 53.7m (L)*. Of course, because of the modularity factor in the design, the spaceship can easily be expanded lengthwise, and even widthwise or heightwise, if needed.

This large size is the critical factor which allows for the resilience of the mission, through the previously mentioned factor of [Redundancy](#redundancy). Without the large size of the **RUBBER I**, effective usage of segmentation, modularity and redundancy would not be possible.

Furthermore, the large size allows for the transport, confort and facilities to support many people, including the [50 Astronauts](/section/05-astronauts#how-many) planned for the initial mission.

## Power

### Solar Panels

One of the main power sources, of which will be on the **RUBBER I**, is Solar Panels, as shown in Figure 4.
